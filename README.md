As I have time to work through the problems, I will periodically update my solutions. 
If you notice an incorrect solution, please let me know.

Thanks.

The LaTeX code for the tetrahedron in section 1.2 problem 9 came from [TeX-SX](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/174317/creating-a-labeled-tetrahedron-with-tikzpicture/174424) and was authored by [Ignasi](http://tex.stackexchange.com/users/1952/ignasi).
